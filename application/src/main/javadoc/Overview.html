This simple application illustrates the use of Spring, several new components,
new testing infrastructure and architectural patterns
that are under consideration for inclusion in Cheetah.

<h2>Application Overview -- "Mifos Cheetah"</h2>


<h2>Technology Stack</h2>

<p>
The application makes use of these components and frameworks:

<ul>
	<li>Spring framework components, specifically
		<ul>
			<li>Spring MVC, including form controllers, commands, and validators</li>
			<li>dependency injection all over the place</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>FreeMarker (JSP alternative)</li>
	<li>JodaTime</li>
	<li>TestNG</li>
	<li>Maven2 (basic configuration, but enough to build and run tests)</li>
	<li>PMD and FindBugs (basic configuration)</li>
	<li>Spring Security (authentication provider uses database via jdbc for users and roles)</li>
	<li>JPA-based data access objects (DAOs).
		<ul>
			<li>Hibernate is used as the underlying JPA engine.</li>
			<li>Spring framework is used to simplify persistence code</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
   <li>Selenium acceptance testing, driven via TestNG</li>
	
</ul>

<h2>Running the application</h2>

<p>
The application is built using Maven 2.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>First be sure that <code>src/main/resources/jdbc.properties</code> is 
	correctly configured for your local environment. All environmental dependencies
   should be located there.</li>
   <li>Run <code>mvn sql:execute</code> to create the database and load data.</li>
	<li>Run <code>mvn clean install</code> to compile the application and deploy it to the 
	project's /target directory.</li>
	<li>Run <code>mvn javadoc:javadoc</code> to generate javadoc in the 
	/target/site/apidocs directory.</li>
	<li>Run the goals <code>mvn sql:execute</code> to initialize and populate the database 
	with test data.</li>
	<li>Start Tomcat and go to <code>http://localhost:8080/springapp/hello.ftl</code>. 
	You should see a login page.</li>
   <li>Login with login <code>admin</code> and password <code>password</code>. You should see 
	a welcome page with the list of products inserted into the database.</li>
	<li>Click the Increase Price link. Enter a percentage and press <code>execute</code>. 
	You are taken back to the welcome page to view the increased prices. If you enter 
	negative numbers or percentages that are above 50 you will see error messages.</li>
   <li>Login <code>user1</code> and password <code>password</code> cannot use the price 
   increase page, so you will get a "Bad credentials" error if you log in with these credentials 
   and try to use this page.</li>
   <li>Login <code>user2</code> is disabled, so you will get a "User disabled"
   error if you log in with these credentials and try to use this page.</li>
   <li>If you log in with the wrong user or password, you should see an error page.</li>
</ol>

<p/>

<h2>Running the Selenium acceptance tests</h2>

<ol>
   <li>You must use Firefox 2, installed in the standard location for your platform. For more info, see the 
       <a href="http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/tutorial.html">Selenium RC tutorial</a>.</li>
   <li>You can only run the acceptance tests from inside Eclipse one at a time right now. This will change in the near future.</li>
   <li>Do a <code>mvn clean install</code> from the command line. All the tests should pass. This does not run the acceptance tests.</li>
   <li>Start your web server, either from Eclipse WTP or externally.</li>
   <li>Start the Selenium server from the command line by typing <code>mvn selenium:start-server</code>. This will start a selenium server 
       on the console - it will launch a web browser when commanded to by the tests.</li>
   <li>Open the test you want to run in Eclipse, and run it via TestNG. This will open a web browser and execute the tests.</li> 
</ol>

<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>


The application, "springapp", grew from the example described in a
 <a href="http://static.springframework.org/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/">
tutorial </a> on the Spring Framework. It has been extended to more explicitly
illustrate architectural patterns that are proposed to include in Cheetah.
<p/>
This example has been ported from ant to maven2, and modified so that it will 
work in Eclipse WTP.
<p/>


<h2>Layered Architecture</h2>
<p>
The architectural layering follows roughly that proposed by Eric Evans in
 <a href="">Domain-Driven Design</a>. Each layer has narrow, well-defined responsibilities.
</p>

<h3>User Interface Layer</h3>
<p>
Shows information to the user and interprets user's commands. Does
<strong>NOT</strong> implement any business logic other than low-level validation of
user input. It is further broken down into the two usual parts:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Presentation</strong></dt>
	<dd>Formats the views and receives user commands. Receives models to
		display from the control layer, and forwards commands to that layer. This
		application uses Java ServerPages, but eventually will be ported
		to FreeMarker.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Control</strong></dt>
	<dd>Implements the logic to determine the view, validate user input, and interpret 
		and act on user commands. Requests that a service in the next layer down carry out 
		the command. This application uses Spring MVC, for example in
		{@link springapp.web.controllers.InventoryController} and
		{@link springapp.web.controllers.PriceIncreaseFormController}, as well as
		with commands ({@link springapp.web.commands.PriceIncrease} and
		command validators (springapp.web.commands.PriceIncreaseValidator}
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Service (AKA Application) Layer</h3>

<p>
Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do. Coordinates
tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain objects in the next layer down.
</p>

<p>
See {@link springapp.service.SimpleProductService}, which implements interface
{@link springapp.service.ProductService}.
</p>

<h3>Domain Layer</h3>

<p>
Represents concepts of the business, information about the business
situation, and business rules. Controls the state of the business situation, but technical
details of storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. All logic of the business should
reside in these objects. The only example here is {@link springapp.domain.Product}, which
is pretty stupid, unfortunately.
</p>

<h3>Repository Layer</h3>

<p>
Although Evans does not explicitly identify this pattern as a separate layer, it is an important
component in the life cycle of business entities, and is critical in meeting Cheetah's 
architectural goals. So we single it out here.
<p>

<p>
Repositories decouple business entities from the technical complexities (e.g. Hibernate, SQL)
of persistence). A repository provides the illusion of an in-memory collection of all objects
of some type. It provides methods for adding and removing objects, as well as selecting objects
based on some criteria.
</p>

<p>
In spring, repositories are implemented using DAOs, as represented here with interface
{@link springapp.repository.ProductDao} and implementation {@link springapp.repository.JpaProductDao}.
</p>

<h3>Infrastructure Layer</h3>

<p>Provides generic technical capabilities that support the higher
layers. The infrastructure may also support the pattern of interactions between the four
layers through an architectural framework. Examples of components that provide such
capabilities are
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spring Framework</li>
	<li>Hibernate</li>
	<li>Servlet container</li>
	<li>FreeMarker</li>
</ul>

<h2>Layer interactions</h2>

<p>
Each layer interacts with the one below it using either a very simple pattern, or
transparently using Spring's dependency injection. Moreover higher layers reference
entities in lower layers using interfaces. Specific examples follow in the next sections.
</p>

<h3>Presentation Layer--Service Layer interactions</h3>

<p>
{@link springapp.web.controllers.InventoryController} is injected with the 
stateless service {@link springapp.service.SimpleProductService} and invokes 
user-requested, product-related
business functions (show products, increase price) by referencing the interface
{@link springapp.service.ProductService}
</p>

<h3>Service Layer -- Domain Layer interactions</h3>

<p>
{@link springapp.service.SimpleProductService} retrieves and saves modified
{@link Product} instances using
interface {@link springapp.repository.ProductDao}.
</p>

<h3>Domain Layer -- Infrastructure Layer interactions</h3>

<p>
Domain layer entity Product does not directly interact with any other layers. In a more complex
application, domain entities will interact with other business objects. Domain objects worry
about business function, nothing else.
</p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>

<p>
This application illustrates the implementation of several
<a href="">goals</a> of the Cheetah project:
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Simplicity</strong></dt>
	<dd>layered architecture, combined with Spring and other supporting infrastructure,
	simplifies the application in several ways:
		<ul>
			<li>Layers invoke services of lower layers with simple interfaces.</li>
			<li>By division of responsibilities and separation of concerns among layers,
			objects are not cluttered with technical complexities or responsibilities that are not
			their primary concern.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>Testability</strong></dt>
	<dd> 
	<p> The application layering, combined with Spring dependency injection and other
	features, allow lower-layer objects to be easily mocked up.. Examples:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>When unit-testing {@link springapp.web.controllers.InventoryController},
				ProductService is mocked-up using an anonymous inner class in
				{@link springapp.web.controllers.InventoryControllerTests}.
			</li>
			<li>When testing {@link springapp.service.SimpleProductService}, the product repository,
			ProductDao, is mocked up with an implementation that mimics an in-memory database 
				({@link springapp.repository.InMemoryProductDao}). See 
				{@link springapp.service.SimpleProductServiceTests}.
			</li>	
			<li> Services are stateless. Controllers access services transparently using
				Spring dependency injection</li>
			<li> The package <a href="TODO">JodaTime</a> is used to mock system time when testing.
			See {@link springapp.web.controllers.InventoryControllerTests} for an example.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	Moreover, all objects in all layers are just POJOS, enabling them to be tested outside of
	any container.
	</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Issues, Decisions to be made</h2>

<h3> Package Structure</h3>

<ol>
	<li> Does the package structure shown here seem like a reasonable starting point?
	<li> Should we continue the convention of adding subfolders for business areas or functions?
	     If not, the packages ..web/controllers and others will get very large.
</ol>
